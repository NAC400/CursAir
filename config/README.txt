Notes:
Virtual Environment: setup.py creates a virtual environment named venv using python -m venv venv.

Dependencies: It installs all packages listed in requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Environment Variables: Adjust set_environment_variables() function to set environment variables like SERVER_HOST and SERVER_PORT as per your project's needs.

Advantages:
Python-based: Enables platform-independent scripting for setup tasks.

Customization: You can add more setup steps (like database migrations) or adjust environment configurations easily within the script.

Further Customization:
Depending on your project requirements, you can enhance the script to include additional setup tasks or validations.

For more complex setups involving Docker or deployment automation, consider integrating with tools like Fabric or using containerization technologies.

This approach helps automate the setup process, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying the onboarding of new developers or deployments to new machines. If you have specific requirements or encounter issues while implementing this setup, feel free to ask for further assistance!
